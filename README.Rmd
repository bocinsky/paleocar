paleocar
========

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/bocinsky/paleocar.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bocinsky/paleocar)
<!-- [![rstudio mirror downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/paleocar)](https://github.com/metacran/cranlogs.app) -->
[![cran version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/paleocar)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=paleocar)

`paleocar` is an *R* package implementing functions to perform spatio-temporal paleoclimate reconstruction from tree-rings using the CAR (Correlation Adjusted corRelation) approach of Zuber and Strimmer as implemented in the [`care` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=care) for *R*. It is optimized for speed and memory use.

This is based on the approach used in Bocinsky and Kohler (2014):

Bocinsky, R. K. and Kohler, T. A. (2014). A 2,000-year reconstruction of the rain-fed maize agricultural niche in the US Southwest. *Nature Communications*, 5:5618. doi: [10.1038/ncomms6618](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/141204/ncomms6618/full/ncomms6618.html).

The primary difference between the latest version of `paleocar` and that presented in Bocinsky and Kohler (2014) is, here, model selection is performed by minimizing the corrected Akaike's Information Criterion.

A more recent reference would be Bocinsky et al. (2016):

Bocinsky, R. K., Rush, J., Kintigh, K. W., and Kohler, T. A. (2016). Exploration and exploitation in the macrohistory of the pre-Hispanic Pueblo Southwest. *Science Advances*, 2:[e1501532](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1501532).

This package has been built and tested on a source (Homebrew) install of *R* on macOS 10.12 (Sierra), and has been successfully run on Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (Trusty), Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (Xenial) and binary installs of *R* on Mac OS 10.12 and Windows 10.

### Development
+ [Kyle Bocinsky](http://bocinsky.io) - Crow Canyon Archaeological Center, Cortez, CO

### Install `paleocar`
+ Development version from GitHub:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bocinsky/paleocar")
library(paleocar)
```
+ Linux (Ubuntu 14.04.5 or 16.04.1):

First, in terminal:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa -y
sudo apt-get update -q
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev netcdf-bin libnetcdf-dev gdal-bin libgdal-dev
```
Then, in R:
```r
update.packages("survival")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bocinsky/paleocar")
library(paleocar)
```

### Demonstration
This demo script is available in the `/inst` folder at the location of the installed package.

#### Load `paleocar` and set a working directory
```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(paleocar)
library(magrittr) # The magrittr package enables piping in R.
library(ggplot2)

# Set a directory for testing
testDir <- "./paleocar_test/"
# and create it if necessary
dir.create(testDir, showWarnings=F, recursive=T)

```

#### Load test datasets
`paleocar` ships with test files defining a study area (Mesa Verde National Park), and pre-extracted data from the International Tree Ring Databank using the [`FedData` package](https://github.com/bocinsky/FedData). See the `data-raw/data.R` script (or the documentation for `FedData`) to learn how to download these data.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Load spatial polygon for the boundary of Mesa Verde National Park (MVNP) in southwestern Colorado:
data(mvnp)

# Get Tree-ring data from the ITRDB for 10-degree buffer around MVNP
data(itrdb)

# Get 1/3 arc-second PRISM gridded data for the MVNP north study area (water-year [October--September] precipitation, in millimeters)
data(mvnp_prism)

```

#### Run `paleocar`
`paleocar` can be run for either single location given by a vector of annualized climate data, a matrix of locations, or over gridded climate data such as PRISM in raster format. There are three primary functions:

- `paleocar_models()` calculates the CAR-ranked linear models for all reconstructions
- `predict_paleocar_models()` generates climate predictions over a specified prediction period, and
- `uncertainty_paleocar_models()` generates an estimate of model uncertainty over a specified prediction period.

Finally, the `paleocar()` method is a convenience wrapper that runs all three of these functions and returns a list with their output. See the documentation for each function for details.

##### `paleocar` reconstruction for a single location
`paleocar` may be run for a single location by providing a vector of annualized values to be reconstructed. Simply provide a numeric vector the same length as your calibration years as the `predictands` parameter.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Extract a vector of annualized climate data (the first cell in the raster)
mvnp_prism.vector <- mvnp_prism[1][1,]

test.vector <- paleocar_models(predictands = mvnp_prism.vector,
                               chronologies = itrdb,
                               calibration.years = 1924:1983,
                               prediction.years = 1:2000,
                               verbose = T)

# Generate predictions and uncertainty (and plot timeseries of each)                             
test.prediction <- predict_paleocar_models(models = test.vector,
                                           prediction.years = 600:1299)

test.prediction %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = Prediction)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Prediction - `PI Deviation`,
                  ymax = Prediction + `PI Deviation`),
              color = NA,
              fill = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_line(size = 0.2)

```


##### `paleocar` reconstruction for multiple locations using the same set of predictors (in this case, tree-ring chronologies)
Running `paleocar` on a matrix of locations (`predictands`) will generate reconstructions that select from
the same set of predictors (`chronologies`). The matrix must be formatted such that each location is in a column, and each row is a year of data. Note that the number of rows of the matrix must be the same as the
number of years provided to `calibration.years`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Extract a matrix of annualized climate data (all cells in the raster)
mvnp_prism.matrix <- mvnp_prism %>%
  raster::as.matrix() %>% 
  t()

test.matrix <- paleocar_models(predictands = mvnp_prism.matrix,
                               chronologies = itrdb,
                               calibration.years = 1924:1983,
                               prediction.years = 1:1985,
                               verbose = T)

# Generate predictions and uncertainty (and plot location means in uncertainty)
test.prediction <- predict_paleocar_models(models = test.matrix,
                                           prediction.years = 600:1299)

test.prediction %>%
  dplyr::mutate(cell = as.factor(cell)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(cell %in% c(1,200,400,600)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = `Prediction (scaled)`)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `Prediction (scaled)` - `PI Deviation (scaled)`,
                  ymax = `Prediction (scaled)` + `PI Deviation (scaled)`,
                  fill = cell),
              color = NA) +
  geom_line(size = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~cell, nrow = 2) +
  xlab("Year CE")

```

##### `paleocar` reconstruction over a grid
Paleocar can also be performed over a gridded climate dataset such as PRISM, so long as it is a `RasterStack` or `RasterBrick` as defined in the [`raster` package for *R*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster). Results will be returned in `RasterBrick` format.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Print to show format
mvnp_prism

test.raster <- paleocar_models(predictands = mvnp_prism,
                               chronologies = itrdb,
                               calibration.years = 1924:1983,
                               prediction.years = 600:1299,
                               verbose = T)

# Generate predictions and errors
test.raster.predictions <- predict_paleocar_models(models = test.raster,
                                                   prediction.years = 600:1299)

test.raster.predictions$`Prediction (scaled)` %>%
  raster::mean() %>%
  raster::plot()

# test.raster.predictions$`PI Deviation (scaled)` %>%
#   raster::mean() %>%
#   raster::plot()

```

##### `paleocar()` convenience wrapper
The `paleocar()` convenience wrapper returns a list containing the `models`, `reconstructions`, and `uncertainty`. The `paleocar()` method also automatically saves the output of `predict_paleocar_models()` and `errors_paleocar_models()`. Pass variables through this function to other ones (e.g., `meanVar = "chained"`).

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Generate models and perform the reconstruction and error predictions.

mvnp_models <- paleocar_models(predictands = mvnp_prism,
                       label = "mvnp_prism",
                       chronologies = itrdb,
                       calibration.years = 1924:1983,
                       prediction.years = 600:1299,
                       out.dir = testDir,
                       force.redo = T,
                       verbose = T)

mvnp_recon <- paleocar(models = mvnp_models,
                       predictands = mvnp_prism,
                       label = "mvnp_prism",
                       chronologies = itrdb,
                       calibration.years = 1924:1983,
                       prediction.years = 600:1299,
                       out.dir = testDir,
                       force.redo = T,
                       verbose = T)

mvnp_recon <- paleocar(predictands = mvnp_prism,
                       label = "mvnp_prism",
                       chronologies = itrdb,
                       calibration.years = 1924:1983,
                       prediction.years = 600:1299,
                       out.dir = testDir,
                       force.redo = T,
                       verbose = T)

# Examine the structure of the output
str(mvnp_recon, 
    max.level = 2)

```

You can quickly load a prior reconstruction by setting `force.redo = FALSE`:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Generate models and perform the reconstruction and error predictions.
mvnp_recon <- paleocar(predictands = mvnp_prism,
                       label = "mvnp_prism",
                       chronologies = itrdb,
                       calibration.years = 1924:1983,
                       prediction.years = 600:1299,
                       out.dir = testDir,
                       force.redo = F,
                       verbose = T)

```

#### Plot results

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mvnp_recon$predictions$Prediction %>%
  raster::mean() %>%
  raster::plot()

mvnp_recon$predictions$`PI Deviation` %>%
  raster::mean() %>%
  raster::plot()

mvnp_recon$predictions$`Prediction (scaled)` %>%
  raster::mean() %>%
  raster::plot()

mvnp_recon$predictions$`PI Deviation (scaled)` %>%
  raster::mean() %>%
  raster::plot()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```
