Description: Functions to perform spatio-temporal paleoclimate reconstruction
    from tree-rings using the CAR (Correlation Adjusted corRelation) approach of
    Zuber and Strimmer (2011). It is optimized for speed and memory use. This is
    the approach used in Bocinsky and Kohler (2014): Bocinsky, R. K. and Kohler, T. A. (2014). 
    A 2,000-year reconstruction of the rain-fed maize agricultural niche in the US Southwest. 
    *Nature Communications*, 5:5618. The primary difference is that here model selection is performed
    by minimizing the corrected Akaike's Information Criterion.
